# Classification with least squares

This contains a notebook `project.ipynb` which goes through how to get a decent solution to the MNIST dataset with nothing but linear algebra (no gradient descent).

We also do some feature engineering to see whether a nonlinear mapping from the data to the feature space can help our linear model perform better.
